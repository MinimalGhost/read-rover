# Read-Rover

Single page app for searching current and recent news articles.

## Intalling / Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and a [react](https://reactjs.org/) based frontend with [semantic-ui-react](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction). Credit to [react-alert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-alert) for easily implemented user alerts and [News API](https://newsapi.org/) for all content.

### Setup

Fork and/or clone the repository, then in terminal from the top level directory `cd` into `read-rover` and run:
```
npm install && npm start
```
to get dependencies installed locally and have it running on your local host. Because it is a Create-React app this will automatically open a browser window pointing to the frontend and you will be able to interact from there.
